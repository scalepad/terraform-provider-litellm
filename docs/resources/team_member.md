# litellm_team_member Resource

Manages individual team member configurations in LiteLLM. This resource allows you to add, update, and remove team members with specific permissions and budget limits.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "litellm_team_member" "engineer" {
  team_id            = litellm_team.engineering.id
  user_id            = "user_3"
  user_email         = "engineer@example.com"
  role               = "user"
  max_budget_in_team = 200.0
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `team_id` - (Required) The ID of the team this member belongs to.

- `user_id` - (Required) Unique identifier for the user.

- `user_email` - (Required) Email address of the user.

- `role` - (Required) The role of the team member. Valid values are:

  - `org_admin`
  - `internal_user`
  - `internal_user_viewer`
  - `admin`
  - `user`

- `max_budget_in_team` - (Optional) Maximum budget allocated to this team member within the team's budget.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to the arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - The unique identifier for the team member configuration. This is typically a composite of the team_id and user_id.

## Import

Team members can be imported using the format `team_id:user_id`:

```shell
terraform import litellm_team_member.engineer <team_id>:<user_id>
```

### Import Blocks (Terraform 1.5+)

For Terraform 1.5 and later, you can use import blocks for a more declarative approach:

```hcl
import {
  to = litellm_team_member.engineer
  id = "<team_id>:<user_id>"
}

resource "litellm_team_member" "engineer" {
  # Configuration will be populated after import
  team_id            = "team_123"
  user_id            = "user_456"
  user_email         = "engineer@example.com"
  role               = "user"
  max_budget_in_team = 200.0
}
```

Import blocks are the recommended approach for Terraform 1.5+ as they provide better integration with Terraform's planning and state management.

Note: The team_id and user_id should match the values used in the resource configuration.

## Security Note

Ensure that sensitive information such as user emails and IDs are handled securely. It's recommended to use variables or a secure secret management solution rather than hardcoding these values in your Terraform configuration files.
